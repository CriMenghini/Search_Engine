# Search_Engine
It was the first project of my life. When i wrote it ( in mid-november) it'd been just one month that i was programming. I built it in 2 weeks. It doen't contain bugs, I mean, it works. But, actually, I think that there are many lines that may be dropped out, and many function that couldi be make better.
